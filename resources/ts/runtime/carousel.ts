/**
 * NextSaaS shared carousel runtime.
 *
 * One native scroll-snap strip serves both the journal carousel and the
 * testimonial section: touch, the wheel, the arrow keys on the focused track and
 * the two step buttons all move the same scroll container, so nothing animates a
 * transform track and every snap point stays reachable without JavaScript.
 *
 * The bundle is loaded through `resources/ts/runtime/blocks.ts`, which boots one
 * instance per root and hands the returned teardown back when the root leaves the
 * document. Nothing here reads a document-wide singleton, so two carousels on one
 * page keep their own counter, their own disabled states and their own keyboard
 * handling.
 *
 * The counter format, the step distance and the edge tolerance are shared on
 * purpose: the two consumers have to behave identically, and this module replaced
 * the testimonial block's private copy of exactly this logic.
 *
 * Node vocabulary: the testimonial renderer marks its nodes with the long
 * `data-nextsaas-carousel-*` names it shipped with, the journal renderer with the
 * shorter `data-nextsaas-*` names, and the layout classes (`.carousel-viewport`,
 * `.carousel-card`, `.voice-slide`) come from the shared primitives in
 * `resources/css/modules/25-sections.css`. Both vocabularies are resolved below.
