/**
 * On-canvas rich-text overlay for NextSaaS blocks.
 *
 * A NextSaaS block previews its PHP output through `ServerSideRender` inside
 * `.nextsaas-block-preview__surface`, which the shared editor stylesheet makes
 * inert. This overlay puts a real `RichText` on top of the server-rendered text
 * for the attributes that map 1:1 to a stable element, so they are edited where
 * they appear instead of in the sidebar, and it hides the underlay with
 * `visibility: hidden` only — never `display: none` — so the block's layout and
 * page height stay identical while editing.
 *
 * Geometry: the root is a zero-sized absolutely-positioned div mounted after the
 * preview. It changes no layout and, being positioned itself, is the containing
 * block for the editor boxes inside it. Each box is placed straight from the
 * difference between its element's client rect and the root's client rect,
 * measured in one pass, so the offset is scroll-invariant and no scroll listener
 * is needed. The box copies the underlay's computed typography, so the text sits
 * exactly where it does on the front end at every breakpoint.
 *
 * The editor is re-measured (rAF-throttled) when the preview mutates, when the
 * wrapper resizes or when the window resizes, and every measure pass restores the
 * elements it hid, so a target that disappears simply stops being overlaid.
 *
 * Attachment and measurement are deliberately separate concerns. The observers are
 * attached to the structural block wrapper (and to the list holding it) as soon as
 * the overlay mounts and are never gated on the preview existing, because
 * `ServerSideRender` lands its preview a fraction of a second after selection and a
 * freshly inserted block has none at all: an attachment gate would leave nothing
 * watching for the arrival, so the first selection would render no editor until the
 * block was selected a second time. Attachment retries briefly if the wrapper is not
 * reachable in the commit that mounts the overlay, and a bounded set of delayed
 * measurements covers the one arrival no observer can promise to see — the preview
 * itself is a network round trip. The measuring pass is the strict half — it
 * resolves the surface *and* the targets on every run, so it simply renders nothing
 * until both are there.
 *
 * A target whose element is not in the current output is skipped on its own and
 * never disturbs the rest: several rich values only render in a state the preview
 * is not in (`nextsaas/search-results` prints its recovery link label only for an
 * empty result set), and a value with no element has nothing to measure, so the
 * overlay leaves the preview authoritative for it until that state appears.
 *
 * `data-nextsaas-rich` is emitted by `render.php`, so the marker is present in the
 * front-end HTML as well as in the editor canvas: both render the same PHP, and
 * the overlay needs the hook in that output to find and measure the element. It is
 * a mapping hook only — nothing is editable on the front end, and displays that
 * read it stay `visibility: visible` (hidden only while an editor box covers the
 * element). Do not gate it on REST_REQUEST or on `is_admin()`.
 *
 * All styling is inline: this module owns no stylesheet.
