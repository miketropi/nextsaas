/**
 * Single source of truth for the URL token grammar accepted by the NextSaaS theme.
 *
 * The tokens below are implemented once, in PHP, by
 * `inc/blocks/helpers.php::nextsaas_resolve_url()`: `@notes` resolves to the
 * configured posts archive, `@search` to the search endpoint, a leading `#` is
 * passed through as a fragment, a leading `?` is appended to the site root, and
 * anything else is resolved against the site. Every inspector control whose value
 * reaches that helper reuses this text, so the grammar is documented exactly
 * once and cannot drift between the twenty-five blocks.
